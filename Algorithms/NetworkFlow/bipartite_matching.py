"""
Bipartite Matching complexity analysis:

Time complexity:
    If using ford-fulkerson's:
    - Overall O(E*max_flow), where max_flow = O(V)

    If using Hopcroft-Karp, which uses a faster max flow algorithm:
    - Overall O(sqrt(V) * E)

    Note we do not explicitly need to create the flow network to solve
    this problem. 

    + O(V) for constructing new adj_list with new source and sink
    + O(V+E) dfs for finding all saturated edges
